# Analytics Rails

Adds a helper to create the google analytics script in rails.

## Why

I did this gem to:

- Have a simple but versatile way to include google analytics.

## Install

Put this line in your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'analytics-rails'
```

Then bundle:
```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Include tag must be added before any other tag in order to work and only will be shown in production.

### Include

In your layout add a line like this in your head:
```erb
<%= google_analytics_include_tag 'UA-000000-01' %>
```

You can add metrics if you want:
```erb
<%= google_analytics_include_tag 'UA-000000-01', category: 'products' %>
```

### Events

To send events add a line like this with the category and action:
```erb
<%= google_analytics_event_tag 'Video', 'play' %>
```

You can add label, value and other options too if you want:
```erb
<%= google_analytics_event_tag 'Video', 'play', 'demo.mp4', 42, category: 'product' %>
```

## Contributing

Any issue, pull request, comment of any kind is more than welcome!

I will mainly ensure compatibility to PostgreSQL, AWS, Redis, Elasticsearch, FreeBSD and Memcached.Â
